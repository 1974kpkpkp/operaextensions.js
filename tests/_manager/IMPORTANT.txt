to make it working to testcase background.html add following script {as a las one}
SenderID is id of manager-extension. Should be as defined below(I added key to manifest and hope it force browser to generate such extension id). As far I didn't find better way for this.

var senderID = "nandnlijbdgklpggddgnojncccikgcfa";
add_completion_callback(function(tests, status) {
    var log = document.querySelector("#log #results");
    var msg = encodeURIComponent(log.innerHTML);
    chrome.extension.sendMessage(senderID, msg);
});

All extensions to test should have name starting with "tc-", should be installed and disabled (I should make this on the beginning of test - doing soon).
Then you need run extension. At the end raport should be visible in tab.
